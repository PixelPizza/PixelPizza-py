Description
---
An alternate version of the pixel pizza bot for if the website is down  
This is the c# version of the bot

Note
---
You are allowed to make your own version using my code, but keep in mind that if you use this code you will have to configure many things to get it working. **Pixel Pizza is not going to help setting up, because of the amount of time that takes**

Commands
---
There are no commands for this version yet, i'm still working on making the main file

Visual Studio Code Extension
---
The Pixel Pizza visual studio code extension does not have python snippets, it will come soon
